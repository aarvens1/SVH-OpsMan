name: day-ender
description: End-of-day wrap-up. Covers the period since the last day-starter or day-ender ran, with a 24-hour cap. Falls back to 12h if no state exists. Override with "last N hours" or "reset" to use defaults. Trigger phrases: "day ender", "wrap up today", "end of day", "EOD".
when_to_use: Use at the end of each workday to close out the day cleanly.

# Day Ender

## Time window

### Step 0 — Compute the lookback window

1. Get the current timestamp from session context (injected by session-start hook — do not call a time tool).
2. Check whether the user specified an explicit override in their invocation:
   - **"reset"** or **"default"**: skip the state file. Use 12h. Write current timestamp to state after the run.
   - **"last N hours"** / any explicit time range: use that window. Write current timestamp to state after the run.
3. If no override, read `System/briefing-state.md` from the Obsidian vault:
   - If the file doesn't exist or can't be parsed: treat as no state.
   - Prefer `last_day_ender` as the reference point. If absent, fall back to `last_day_starter`.
   - If the chosen timestamp is present and **≤ 24 hours ago**: set the window to `now − that timestamp`.
   - If missing or **> 24 hours ago**: fall back to 12h. Log "No recent state found — using default window" in the note.
4. Note the computed window — use it as **N hours** in all data queries below.

## Step 1 — Gather close-out data

The day-starter already established the morning baseline. This step gathers only what you need to close out the day — what moved, what's still live, what came in.

Run in parallel:
- `planner_get_user_tasks` (user_id: `config.user.upn`, open_only: true) — Aaron's tasks across all boards. Cross-reference against the morning briefing to identify what closed and what's still open.
- `todo_list_task_lists` (user_id: `user.entra_id` from config) then `todo_list_tasks` (user_id: `user.entra_id` from config) — unchecked personal To Do items. **Always use the Entra object ID, not the UPN** — the UPN returns HTTP 403 with application credentials.
- `mde_list_alerts` + `wazuh_search_alerts` — security alerts still active. Compare against morning briefing — note only what's new or still unresolved. (If Wazuh unavailable, skip and note it.)
- `entra_list_risky_users` — any still-open risky users.
- `entra_get_sign_in_logs` (risk_only: true, hours: since last_day_starter, top: 500) — risky sign-ins that occurred during the day. Surface only: new accounts not in the morning briefing, or escalation of accounts already flagged this morning. If nothing new: one line. Use hours computed from last_day_starter timestamp, not the full ender lookback window.
- `entra_get_audit_logs` (security_events_only: true, hours: since last_day_starter, top: 200) — security-category directory changes since morning. Surface only genuinely new events not visible at day-start: role assignments, MFA changes, app consent, policy changes, user creation/deletion.
- Ninja devices: call `staging_status` — if fresh, use `staging_read { file: "ninja-alerts" }` for the EOD comparison (faster). Fall back to `ninja_list_servers` → `ninja_list_device_alerts` if staging is stale. Note only alerts new since morning or still active.
- UniFi: call `staging_read { file: "unifi-alerts" }` if staging is fresh. Fall back to `unifi_list_sites` if stale. Check for active issues only: offlineDevice > 0, criticalNotification > 0, or primary WAN downtime.
- `mail_search` — search for emails received since `last_day_starter` timestamp (from the state file). Focus on external senders, flagged items, and anything needing a reply. This is the explicit EOD mail check — do not skip it.
- For DMs: `teams_list_my_chats` → `teams_get_chat_messages` (top: 10, as a **number not a string**) for threads with activity since `last_day_starter`. IT Team channels: `teams_list_teams` → `teams_list_channels` → `teams_list_messages` on General, Changes, Infrastructure, Alerts. Filter to messages after `last_day_starter`.
- `confluence_search_pages` — pages modified today in INF, PROC, POL, SITE.
- `gmail_list_recent` — personal Gmail inbox since `last_day_starter`. Unread messages and anything flagged needing a reply.
- `gtasks_list_task_lists` then `gtasks_list_tasks` for each list — Google Tasks status: what's still open or overdue.

## Step 1.5 — Scan for untracked commitments and session value

**Part A — Commitment scan**

Review the current session context for any verbal commitments Aaron made that are not yet captured as Planner tasks or To Do items. Look for phrases like: "I'll...", "I need to...", "I should...", "remind me to...", "I'm going to...", "I have to..."

For each uncaptured commitment found: pre-fill a `#### CREATE —` block in `### Staged Tasks` in the `# Day Ender` section (Step 2, Phase 1). If nothing was committed, skip this step silently.

This compensates for the recurring pattern where in-session intentions don't make it into task tracking.

**Part B — Handoff prompt**

Review the current session for: significant investigations, incidents opened, decisions made, open threads that have no note in the vault yet, or any session where losing context would require re-deriving work.

If any of those apply, prompt before continuing:
> *"Today's [topic] work might be worth a `/handoff` — want me to write one before we close out?"*

If the session was routine (a clean briefing, a few task updates, nothing substantive), skip this silently.

## Step 2 — Write to today's note

This is a two-phase write.

**Phase 1: Add EOD task blocks to Staged Tasks**

The Day Starter already created `### Staged Tasks` inside `# Day Ender`. Add any EOD task blocks from Step 1 findings directly below the morning blocks using `edit_block`:

- **`old_string`**: the last line of the existing `### Staged Tasks` block content (match it precisely — do not target the section header itself)
- **`new_string`**: that last line + a blank line + `#### EOD additions — HH:MM` + the EOD task blocks below it

*EOD focus: UPDATE completed tasks to 100%, UPDATE overdue due dates, CREATE any new items from security/infra/comms findings.*

Generate all task blocks using the formats in `.claude/templates/task-blocks.md` (Read it if needed). EOD priority order: UPDATE completed → UPDATE overdue → CREATE new items from security/infra/comms findings. If there are no new EOD task blocks to add, skip Phase 1 silently.

**Phase 2: Append close-out narrative**

After injecting the evening tasks, append the close-out narrative to the end of the file. **Always use `mode: append`.** Never `mode: rewrite`.

The appended content must NOT include task blocks — those live in `### Staged Tasks` above.

```markdown
## ✅ Closed today
- [What actually got done — based on Planner task state from Step 1 vs. what was open this morning]

## 📨 Communications close-out
- [Emails needing a response from the mail search. External senders and flagged items first. Unresolved DMs or @mentions. This section surfaces findings that feed the Active issues and Still open sections below.]

## 🔴 Active issues at EOD
- [Only alerts or infra problems still live right now, or new since morning. If everything cleared: "✅ No active issues at EOD." Link to any open incident notes: `→ [[Incidents/Active/YYYY-MM-DD-name]]`]

## 🔄 Still open — yours
- [Aaron's tasks only. One line each: task + one-line next action. Not the team board. If the task has a related investigation, incident, or change note, link to it: `→ [[Investigations/YYYY-MM-DD-topic]]`]

## Personal close-out
- [Personal Gmail: unread messages needing a reply tonight, from `gmail_list_recent`. One line per thread: sender + subject. If nothing: "No personal mail needing attention."]
- [Google Tasks: open or overdue tasks from `gtasks_list_tasks`. Format: `[list] — [task]` + due. If nothing overdue: "No overdue Google Tasks."]

## 🌅 First move tomorrow
- [Single item — most time-sensitive or highest-impact.]

## 📌 Carry Forward
**Open (must action):**
- [Item + suggested first move — only things not already captured in Planner]

**Context to hold:**
- [Brief fact worth knowing tomorrow that isn't in Planner]

**Watching:**
- [Item that doesn't need action but should stay on radar]
```

Keep the Carry Forward section tight — 25 lines max. Only include items that would otherwise fall off between sessions. Skip anything already tracked in Planner.

**Processing and cleanup:**

After Aaron confirms and you execute any block (CREATE, UPDATE, TODO, REMOVE), the `edit_block` call to remove the processed block must target it inside `### Staged Tasks` in the `# Day Ender` section.

If any Draft Planner action blocks remain in the daily note at the end of the session (i.e. Aaron did not confirm them), update `has_pending_tasks` to `true` in the daily note's frontmatter using `edit_block`.

**Phase 2.5: Verify write**

Read the daily note file back immediately after Phase 2. Check that `## ✅ Closed today` appears in the content.

- **Present** — continue to Step 3.
- **Absent** — Obsidian Sync likely reverted the file. Re-attempt Phase 2 (append) once. Read the file back again.
  - If present on retry: continue to Step 3 and note "⚠️ Day Ender write required a retry (Obsidian Sync conflict)" at the end of your response.
  - If still absent after retry: **do not proceed silently**. Output the full Day Ender content as a fenced markdown block in the chat so it can be manually pasted. Then surface: "⛔ Day Ender write failed twice — Obsidian Sync conflict. Content is above. Paste into the daily note manually, then confirm and I'll run Steps 3 and 4." Skip Steps 3 and 4 until Aaron confirms the content is in the file.

## Step 3 — Update state file

After the Obsidian note is appended, update `System/briefing-state.md` in the Obsidian vault:
- Set `last_day_ender` to the current ISO timestamp (with timezone offset, e.g. `2026-05-12T17:00:00-07:00`).
- Preserve all other fields (`last_day_starter`, `last_week_starter`, `last_week_ender`).
- Use `mode: rewrite` since this is a state file, not a daily note.

## Step 4 — Run OneDrive backup

After updating the state file, run the OneDrive backup. This writes `last_onedrive_backup` to the state file on success.

Run in a Bash tool call:
```bash
bash ~/SVH-OpsMan/scripts/backup.sh --onedrive-only
```

Wait for it to complete (typically 3–8 minutes on first run, under a minute on subsequent runs). Report the result inline:
- **Success** — note "✅ OneDrive backup complete" at the end of your response.
- **Failure** — note it as `⚠️ OneDrive backup failed — check log at ~/.local/share/svh-opsman/backup-YYYY-MM-DD.log` and surface it in **Active issues at EOD** in the daily note via `edit_block`.

## Skill log

After writing the note, append one line to `System/skill-log.md` in the vault:
`YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM | day-ender | Briefings/Daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md | [N tasks closed, key EOD finding or "clean close"]`
